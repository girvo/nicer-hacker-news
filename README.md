# Nicer HN for Safari 7

So, I run Safari 7, as a lot of us do, and have had issues with 
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) being too small to read, as well as needing 
the ability to collapse comments. The other issue I had was that most of the other 
extensions I came across were for previous versions of Safari, or quite ugly (I rather 
like HN's "retro" stylings), so I quickly hacked something up myself.

## Features

* Collapsible threads, script from [Hacker News Threadify](https://github.com/giu/hacker-news-threadify)
* A small CSS template to take advantage of a crappy, non-portable Zoom feature. Does the job, though

## License

MIT licensed, see ````LICENSE.md````. If you know of any other small useful features, 
send me a pull request, and I'll be happy to merge.

## Download

TBC.
